**CP-31 Master** is the ultimate training companion for Competitive Programmers. It transforms the Codeforces Problemset into a structured training ground based on the famous **CP-31 Sheet**.

Unlike basic filters, this extension injects a **full-featured dashboard** directly into the Codeforces sidebar, featuring progress tracking, daily goals, and smart filtering.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Progress & Tracking
- **🔥 Streak Counter:** Tracks how many consecutive days you have solved at least one CP-31 problem.
- **🎯 Daily Goals:** Set your own daily target (e.g., "Solve 3 problems today"). The badge turns **Gold** when you hit your goal!
- **📈 Visual Progress Bars:** See your completion percentage for every rating level (800-1900) at a glance.

### 🧠 Smart Filtering
- **⚡ Instant Load:** Fetches problems instantly via the Codeforces API (no pagination).
- **🏷️ Advanced Tag Logic:** - **Include Tags:** Find problems with specific topics (e.g., `dp`, `graphs`).
  - **🚫 Exclude Tags:** Hide weak topics or spoilers (e.g., hide `constructive algorithms`).
- **🔍 Status Filters:** Toggle between `All`, `Solved`, or `Unsolved` to focus your practice.

### 🎲 Utility
- **🎲 Random Picker:** Stuck on what to solve? Click "Pick Random" to open a random unsolved problem from your selected rating.
- **🎨 Clean UI:** A native-feeling sidebar integration that blends perfectly with Codeforces.
